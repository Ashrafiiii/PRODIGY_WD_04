        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>I've successfully created an interactive navigation menu that dynamically changes its appearance when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and remains visible on all pages of the website. I've utilized HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity.

          The menu changes its background color when scrolled, providing a visually appealing effect that enhances user experience. Additionally, when hovering over a menu item, the font color changes, providing clear visual feedback to the user. These interactive elements make the navigation menu engaging and intuitive to use.
          
          By implementing this dynamic navigation menu, I've ensured that users can easily navigate through the website while enjoying a visually pleasing and interactive browsing experience. </p>

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>I have successfully built a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was utilized to structure the elements of the application, including buttons for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as displaying the time and lap times.

          With the implementation of JavaScript functions, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. The startStop() function enables users to start and stop the stopwatch, while the lapReset() function allows them to record lap times and reset the stopwatch when needed.
          
          The CSS styling ensures that the stopwatch is visually appealing and user-friendly. The stopwatch web application is interactive and provides a seamless experience for users to track time intervals efficiently.</p>
